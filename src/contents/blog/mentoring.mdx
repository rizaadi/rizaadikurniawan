"I got the internship!"

The WhatsApp message came in around eleven at night. I was sitting in front of my laptop, debugging while sipping cold coffee. I smiled right away. Not just because of the good news, but because I knew the story behind that message. Someone who once struggled to understand "Hello World" was now ready to step into the professional world.

In moments like that, i'm always reminded why mentoring means so much to me.

## Where It All Started

The desire to teach grew long before I knew anything about technology. Since I was a kid, I often sat in the corner of the room watching my parents teach. What stuck with me wasn't just how they explained the material, but how they treated every student with the same patience. No labels of smart or not smart. Just people with one shared goal. Learning.

From there, I started to believe that how we're educated shapes how we treat others. Good education doesn't just make people smarter, it makes them more human. Good and equal education creates a healthy environment, and a healthy environment produces better people.

## Wanting More

That feeling became clearer when I was in college. Almost every course required us to present and explain material in front of the class. At first it felt exhausting. But slowly I realized the lecturers were training something often overlooked in the tech world. Communication skills.

I started paying attention to how lecturers and seniors taught. From there I learned that explaining isn't about how much you know, but how deeply you understand. Every time there was a final project, my friends and I would form small study groups. That's where I started learning to teach for real.

But teaching within campus wasn't enough. Something inside me kept pushing. Something in me wants more. I can't rest.

## Learning to Wait

That drive eventually led me to join Bangkit Academy. This program became a turning point in my journey. Not just because of the material, but because I saw firsthand how structured mentoring could create real impact for many people. i've written the full experience at [Beyond Limits: A Journey with Bangkit Academy](https://www.rizaadikurniawan.com/blog/beyond-limits-a-journey-with-bangkit-academy). Bangkit changed how I view the role of mentors in the tech ecosystem.

After graduating, there was actually an opportunity to become a mentor. But at that time my workload was at its peak. I realized if I forced myself, I wouldn't be able to be fully present. I chose to postpone because I felt I couldn't balance everything.

Sometimes, isn't about moving fast, but knowing when to wait.

The opportunity came back in 2024. I applied as a Capstone Project Advisor and got accepted. I took on two roles, Mobile Development and UI/UX. Considering the time and capacity I had, I mentored three teams consisting of students from various universities.

At that point, I felt like I wasn't just teaching, but learning alongside them.

## The Art of Slowing Down

There's something that always warms my heart when seeing mentees run their first "Hello World". That moment reminds me of myself at the beginning of learning to code. Full of curiosity, awkward, and enthusiastic.

Mentoring forced me to slow down. I could no longer just explain how something works. I had to explain why it works. And in that process, I realized that teaching is the most honest way to test our own understanding.

## The Debugging Lesson

One afternoon, a mentee spent hours looking for a bug. I spotted the cause almost instantly. A small mistake. But I chose not to point it out directly.

I just asked, "What do you think that error message means?"

A few minutes later, they found it themselves.

That's when I learned that growth doesn't come from shortcuts. Growth comes from the process of discovering. A mentor's job isn't to give answers, but to accompany the search.

## When They Don't Need You Anymore

The most beautiful part of mentoring is when you're no longer needed. That's the whole point, making yourself obsolete. When messages come about accepted internships or first jobs landed, I know my role is coming to an end.

Mentoring isn't about making people dependent, but about preparing them to walk on their own. Even surpassing us.

## Becoming a Better Human

Reading feedback always reminds me contributing to someone's growth journey is a privilege, not a burden. and I believe they will continue to achieve great things in the future, with or without me.

Mentoring didn't just make me a better developer. It made me more patient, more empathetic, and more self-aware.

And maybe, that's where the real magic of mentoring lies.
