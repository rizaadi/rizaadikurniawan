When we build apps and start adding lots of features, the application can grow big and complicated, making it tough to maintain. To tackle this, we can use modularization.

## What is Modularization?

Imagine a messy pile of books, and you’re trying to find a self-improvement one.
It’s tricky because everything’s all over the place. But if we organize those
books on shelves by genre, finding what you need gets way easier. For example,
if you want a non-fiction book, you’d just head to the non-fiction section

So, modularization is about splitting our code into small, independent modules, each with a clear purpose. This way, developers can work on specific features without messing with other parts of the app. Plus, it lets us create reusable code that can be shared across modules, cutting down on repeats and keeping things neat.

## Why is Modularization Important?

Picture this: you’re working on an app, especially with a big team. In a typical setup, everyone’s coding in the same `lib` module, which often leads to dependency clashes and headaches. But with modularization, developers can focus on their own modules without worrying about conflicts, boosting their productivity.

Modularization makes our code more organized and easier to read. On top of that, developers can build reusable libraries like widgets or functions that work across the app, reducing duplicate code and keeping everything consistent.

## Implementing Modularization

Let’s create a simple Flutter project with three layers using a monorepo style. The main app is our first layer, features and design system are the second, and the network library is the third.

Here’s how: we’ll make folders for features and libraries, then pop our modules inside. To create a Flutter module, just run this in your terminal:

```bash
flutter create --template=package name_of_module
```

Once you’ve got a few modules, link them to the root project by adding them to the `pubspec.yaml` file in the root and running `flutter pub get`.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml" showLineNumbers
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  login:
    path: ./features/login
```

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml (features home)" showLineNumbers
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  designsystem:
    path: ../../core/designsystem
  network:
    path: ../../core/network
```

After that, you can import and use them anywhere in the app.

```dart title="login_page.dart" showLineNumbers
import 'package:designsystem/designsystem.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:home/home.dart';

class LoginPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const LoginPage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text("Login Page"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            const CustomText('Pokemon Apps'), // Widget from designsystem module
            const SizedBox(height: 10),
            CustomButton(        // Widget from designsystem module
              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.push(
                  context,
                  MaterialPageRoute(
                    builder: (context) => const HomePage(), // Widget from home module
                  ),
                );
              },
              text: "Home",
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

But hold on, what if you’ve got tons of modules? Do you really want to hop between folders and run commands for each one? That sounds like a hassle, right?

## Managing Flutter Packages with Melos

[Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/) is a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) tool that helps manage Dart projects with multiple packages (aka mono-repos). It’s actively developed and powers projects like [FlutterFire](https://github.com/firebase/flutterfire).

With Melos, you can handle lots of packages in one repository. Developers can run tests, build packages, and more all in one go. It’s a time-saver that ramps up productivity. Other perks? It lets you share code between packages (goodbye, duplicates!) and even auto-publishes to [pub.dev](http://pub.dev/). For more details? Check the [Melos docs](https://melos.invertase.dev/).

## Installing Melos

Install Melos globally so it’s ready to use anywhere in your terminal:

```bash
dart pub global activate melos
```

Next, create a `melos.yaml` file in your project’s root and add this:

```yaml title="melos.yaml" showLineNumbers
name: flutter_modularization_example

packages:
  - features/**
  - core/**
```

The `name` is your project’s name, and `packages` lists where your modules live. Melos will whip up a `pubspec_overrides.yaml` file to connect everything during development. Since this file’s just for local use, add it to `.gitignore`:

```yaml
pubspec_overrides.yaml
```

Now, initialize your project by running:

```bash
melos bootstrap
```

This “bootstraps” your project by installing dependencies (`flutter pub get`) and linking all packages.

  height={351}
/>

To clean your project, run:

```bash
melos clean
```

You can also set up custom scripts. For example, to format code, add this to `melos.yaml`:

```yaml title="melos.yaml" showLineNumbers
name: flutter_modularization_example

packages:
  - features/**
  - core/**

scripts:
  format:select:
    run: melos format
    description: Format all Flutter packages in this project
    packageFilters:
      flutter: true
```

Then, in the terminal, run `melos run format:select` and pick which package to format

Bonus tip: if you use VS Code, grab the [Melos extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blaugold.melos-code) for type safety and a handy
GUI.

## Conclusion

Now you’re ready to modularize your Flutter app! By breaking it into small modules, developers can work independently without interfering with others. This saves effort and boosts productivity. Perfect for big, complex apps.

There are tons of ways to do modularization in Flutter. Pick the right one, and you’ll optimize performance, consistency, and your dev experience. If you can work smart, why not? 😂
