</div>

In this project, I use Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Modularization and Dependency Injection. For more detail check on my Github [Repository](https://github.com/rizaadi/Zest)

## Detail

Zest is a minimalist quotes app I use to refresh and deepen my understanding of modern Android development.
For the UI and overall feel, I designed it in Figma, drawing inspiration from the clean and modern experience of [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/).

It’s a small build, but it helped me sharpen my workflow and stay consistent in learning through practice.

### Feature

Zest includes the following features:

- Quote Management: Create, edit, delete, and organize quotes
- Featured Quotes: Mark quotes as featured and browse them in a swipeable card interface
- User Preferences:
  - Dark theme support (Follow System, Light, Dark)
  - Notification settings with customizable intervals
- Modern UI: Minimalist design inspired by [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/) with Material 3 components
- Offline-first: All data stored locally using Room database
