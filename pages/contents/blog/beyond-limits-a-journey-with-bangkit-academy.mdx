## Curiosity

Back in my 5th semester, i had a Mobile Programming Course at university with Flutter as the tech stack. After i wrapped up the course and finished my [Valorantlab project](https://www.rizaadikurniawan.com/project/valorantlab), i got interested in native mobile development. Thatâ€™s when i started looking around to figure out where to start learning. Thatâ€™s when i stumbled upon the Bangkit Academy from [Dicoding instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dicoding).

## Bangkit Academy

Bangkit Academy is a career readiness program that aims to produce high-caliber technical talent for world-class Indonesian technology companies and startups. It is supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia. The Bangkit curriculum offers three interdisciplinary learning paths: Machine Learning, Mobile Development, and Cloud Computing. From Bangkit, we will grow in-demand skills in tech and be prepared to pursue Google Certification, as well as the chance to be selected as the best teams to receive incubation funding for our capstone project.

For more information about Bangkit Academy, you can visit [g.co/bangkit](http://g.co/bangkit).

### Applying to Bangkit

After I found out about Bangkit, I didnâ€™t apply because i wasnâ€™t confident in my English, i wanted to prepare for next year.

In the following year, which was my final year, I pushed myself to apply for the Bangkit Academy Android learning path and took the Assessment Test. Thennn, I was accepted! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ”¥

Just so you know, right now iâ€™m in my final year, juggling my thesis and Bangkit at the same time ðŸ˜…. I know this is going to be a tough and an excited journey, lol. Iâ€™m diving into learning native Android because I wanna snag that Associate Android Developer Certificate and be surrounded by amazing people from other universities. Canâ€™t pass up this chance, though my thesis is still top priority, obviously.

### Learning Methodology

So, in Bangkit, the learning methods consist of: Online self-paced (Dicoding course, Coursera, Qwikilabs), Online Synchronous (ILT, Soft Skills, English, Study Groups, Guest Speaker Sessions), Project-Based (Capstone Project), and Reflection & Consultation.

### Challenge

Iâ€™ve learned Flutter before (semester 5), and at Bangkit i learn Android native, with the programming language being Kotlin and XML for crafting the UI. From Flutter (declarative) to Android native (imperative), this is interesting. I learn Kotlin & XML, which are new to me, and understanding and implementing imperative concepts has been the most challenging and took some time for me to fully i understand it.

Meanwhile, i got a new title for my thesis, but before the final title, i changed topics 3 times ðŸ¤£, changed my thesis advisor, so i have to manage my time. From 5 AM until 7AM, i help my family business, then work on my thesis until 12:00 PM. During this time, i do research, write my thesis, and sometimes go to campus for guidance. After that, i work on Bangkit until 5 PM. At night, itâ€™s flexible i can either work on Bangkit or my thesis, depending on which one is the priority or urgent. If there are no urgent tasks, i learn React and build my web portfolio. I document how i built it and the challenge i faced on this personal web at this [Post](https://www.rizaadikurniawan.com/blog/how-I-built-my-own-portfolio-website). I repeat this process until i finish Bangkit. HAHAHA, what a nerd life ðŸ¤£

## Battling Illness

Yes, i got sick. This nerd life has taken some tradeoffs. Sometimes i rest and donâ€™t do anything for a day, i just want to give my eyes a break from the monitor or smartphone, so i donâ€™t open any social media. Sometimes i read a book if i get bored. At this moment, iâ€™m reading [The Psychology of Money](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness/dp/0857197681). This is a nice book, u guys have to read it ðŸ¤£.

When iâ€™m bored with coding, i just go outside and jog. idk why, but after jogging, i find it quicker to solve bugs in the code instead of spending my whole life finding the bug, lol.

## Capstone Project

Capstone Project has started and everyone is busy to finding a team and getting into one, while iâ€™m working on my thesis ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜…

> Capstone Project is where students work on projects as a team to solve a problems around them. The teams consist of students from different learning path (ML, MD, CC) and different universities

While iâ€™m working on my thesis, sometimes i make time to find a team, chat with other students to ask if there are any available mobile dev positions or not.

### Team

After finding every team, I finally got a team. The team consists of 2 Machine Learning, 2 Cloud Computing, and 2 Mobile Development students, all from different universities. Interestingly, iâ€™m the last person to join this team, and coincidentally, they were in need of 1 Mobile Dev.

### Tradify

Before built the project, we had some discussions about what we would build, which theme we would choose, how we would manage the tasks, present our own ideas, and analyze them using the SWOT Framework.

After our discussion, our idea started with a lack of insight into Traditional Food in this modern era. We want to create a platform where both local and foreign tourists can buy souvenirs that are typical of the region, more precisely in the form of food. We aim to help and bridge MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) / UMKM (Usaha Mikro/Kecil/Menengah) in this field and preserve traditional food culture in Indonesia.

We agreed to build an application that specializes in preserving Indonesian traditional food, which we called Tradify. Basically, with Tradify, both local and foreign tourists will be able to discover their own traditional foods and get the information from there.

Our first idea for Tradify was to create an Indonesian traditional food ordering service (E-commerce App) that could also scan traditional food and provide information about it. During our time at Bangkit, we had mentoring sessions for our capstone project team. We attended two mentoring sessions: one for App Development and the other for UI/UX. In the App Dev session, we asked for recommendations on which tool to use for our backend and database, as well as tips on completing our app. During the UI/UX session, we sought design consultations, including feedback on the designs and logo we had already created. After the mentoring sessions, we made adjustments to our plans. We decided to drop the food ordering service and focus on developing our MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

For more information about Tradify, you can check out my post [here](https://www.rizaadikurniawan.com/project/tradify).

We use Trello to manage and track our tasks. Every week, we also discuss our progress, give advice, and so on. Iâ€™m glad to be part of this team, we support each other and create a safe space for discussion. Sometimes, we even stay up all night to pursue progress ðŸ¤£.

The fun part is that everyone on this team has their own busy schedules and agendas, yet we still make progress on the Capstone Project, even if itâ€™s just a little progress. For example, one team member had a thesis seminar proposal / sempro (thatâ€™s me ðŸ¤£), another had an event on campus, and another had an internship seminar, and so on. Despite all this, we managed to finish the Capstone Project ðŸ˜‚,Â even though there were still some todos left unfinished, and even though we didnâ€™t make it to the top 100 Capstone Projects in Bangkit. Iâ€™m so proud of this team.

## Graduate

Itâ€™s a wrap!! After finishing the course, Capstone Project, attending ILT, etc., we earned points that we could exchange for Bangkit merchandise. The merchandise available includes stickers, keychains, pouches, mugs, lanyards, shirts, and even jackets (the most expensive item).

I traded my points for a sticker, keychain, pouch, and jacket (i have a lot of points ðŸ˜Ž)

### AAD Certification

Bangkit offers free vouchers for global certification from Google, limited to the highest-performing students. If you complete all requirements, theyâ€™ll give you a voucher to take the exam for free.

I got the free voucherÂ and successfully passed the certificate exam ðŸ˜‚

## Appreciation

First of all, i want to give a huge shoutout to Bangkit Academy for giving me such an awesome opportunity and an unforgettable journey over the past 6 months. At Bangkit, iâ€™ve learned so much, i even earned my AAD Certificate, made new friends, and had the privilege of being by an amazing facilitator, kak [Anna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annkarenina/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3BEuVh4Yu%2BQe29Mhuu5AGwiQ%3D%3D), whoâ€™s been an absolute rockstar with all her tips, tricks, and insightful discussions during our weekly consultation sessions.

Iâ€™m also super proud of my Capstone Project team. Weâ€™ve spent countless hours building our project, learning together, and pushing through to finish the app weâ€™ve been working on.

Overall, iâ€™m just really grateful to be surrounded by such amazing people.
